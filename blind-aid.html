The Blind-Aid project consist of developing a cane to help the blind people make their way. The cane developed had wheel at the bottom of the stick, which gives more smooth walk to a visually impared person. The wheel had the special ability of applying brakes whenever it gets a obstacle infront of it. The cane also had the special ability to vibrate if the brakes have been applied.
